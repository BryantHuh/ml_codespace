# Task Checklist

## ðŸ“Š Data Preparation & Cleaning
- [ ] Aggregate relevant data (e.g., Holiday list)
- [ ] Cluster weather codes
- [ ] Check for zero values in the sales column
- [ ] Enrich dataset with additional variables that may be relevant for estimating revenue

## ðŸ§ª Dataset Splitting
- [ ] Split dataset:
  - [ ] Training set: 01.07.2013 â€“ 31.07.2017
  - [ ] Validation set: 01.08.2017 â€“ 31.07.2018
  - [ ] Test set: 01.08.2018 â€“ 31.07.2019

## ðŸ“ˆ Modeling
- [ ] Use a simple linear model to predict the test dataset
- [ ] Evaluate the model performance (aim for RÂ² as close to 1 as possible)
- [ ] Maximize adjusted RÂ² on the training set
- [ ] Document linear regression calculations in the "Baseline Model" directory

## ðŸ“¤ Submission
- [ ] Create `submission.csv` file
- [ ] Ensure row count and IDs match the [sample_submission](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bakery-sales-prediction-summer-2025/data?select=sample_submission.csv)
- [ ] Upload and evaluate the prediction on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bakery-sales-prediction-summer-2025)
