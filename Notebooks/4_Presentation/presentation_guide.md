# Presentation Guide

This guide will help you structure your 8â€“10 minute presentation. Follow the checklist below to ensure all required points are covered.

---

## 1. Title Slide
- List all team members' names.
- Project title: "Bakery Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning"

## 2. Self-Created Variables
- List each variable you engineered (feature engineering).
- Briefly describe what each variable represents and why it was created.

## 3. Visualizations: Bar Charts with Confidence Intervals
- Select two self-created variables.
- Create bar charts (e.g., using Seaborn or Matplotlib) showing their effect on sales, including confidence intervals.
- Insert these charts into your slides.

## 4. Linear Model Optimization
- Present the final linear regression model equation (show the formula with coefficients).
- Report the adjusted RÂ² value.
- Briefly explain how you optimized the model (feature selection, regularization, etc.).

## 5. Missing Value Imputation
- State the type(s) of missing value imputation used (e.g., mean, median, interpolation, etc.).
- Mention for which variables/methods were used.

## 6. Neural Network Optimization
- Show the source code (or a code snippet) that defines your neural network architecture.
- Explain the choices for layers, activation functions, optimizer, etc.
- Include loss function plots for both training and validation sets (from model training history).

## 7. Model Evaluation: MAPE Scores
- Report the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for the overall validation set.
- Report MAPE for each product group (if applicable).
- Highlight the "Worst Fail" (case with highest error) and "Best Improvement" (case with most improved prediction).

## 8. Team Participation
- Assign a section of the presentation to each team member (e.g., data prep, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, etc.).
- Practice transitions so everyone speaks.

---

## Tips
- Keep slides visually clear and not overloaded with text.
- Use bullet points and visuals (charts, code snippets, tables).
- Practice timing to stay within 8â€“10 minutes.
- Prepare to answer questions about your process and results.
